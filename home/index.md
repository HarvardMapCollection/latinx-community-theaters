1. Turtles belong to one of the oldest reptile groups in the world – beating snakes, crocodiles and alligators!

2. These creatures date back to the time of the dinosaurs, *over 200 million years ago – woah*!

3. Turtles are easily recognised by their bony, cartilaginous shell. This super-tough casing acts like a shield to protect them from predators – some turtles can even tuck their head up inside their shell for extra protection!

## Long paragraphs about turtles

_Source: [World Wildlife Foundation](https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/sea-turtle)_

:  Seven different species of sea (or marine) turtles grace our ocean waters, from the shallow seagrass beds of the Indian Ocean, to the colorful reefs of the Coral Triangle and the sandy beaches of the Eastern Pacific. While these **highly migratory species** periodically come ashore to either bask or nest, sea turtles spend the bulk of their lives in the ocean. WWF's work on sea turtles focuses on five of those species: green, hawksbill, loggerhead, leatherback, and olive ridley.

Over the last 200 years, **human activities** have tipped the scales against the survival of these ancient mariners. Slaughtered for their eggs, meat, skin, and shells, sea turtles suffer from poaching and over-exploitation. They also face habitat destruction and accidental capture—known as bycatch—in fishing gear. Climate change has an impact on turtle nesting sites; it alters sand temperatures, which then affects the sex of hatchlings. Nearly all species of sea turtle are now classified as endangered, with three of the seven existing species being critically endangered.


WWF is committed to stopping the decline of sea turtles and works for the recovery of the species. We work to secure environments in which both turtles and the people that depend upon them can survive.

## Top 5 Turtle Destinations

**Costa Rica**
**1. Playa Grande**
: This beautiful beach is one of the top locations in the world to see humongous leatherback turtles all year-round. Of the seven turtle species, this one is the largest of them all, weighing up to around 700 kg (1500 lbs). The leatherbacks’ nesting period is between October and March, so visiting at this time means that you can get a special glimpse of hatching eggs and baby turtles making their way to the water.
: Playa Grande is the world’s second largest nesting place for leatherback turtles. In order to see this amazing species, you’ll need to book a tour guide so that their nesting habits are not disturbed and that the eggs are not harmed in any way. Most of the tours are offered late in the evening, typically after sunset to ensure the safety of the turtles, but don’t worry as your guide will show you everything you need to know and much more.

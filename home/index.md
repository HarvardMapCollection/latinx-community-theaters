# Mapping Cultural Difference
The goal of this webpage is to allow others to follow the progress of this mapping project and understand the immediate and long-term goals and uses of the mapping project.


### About this mapping project
At its inception, this project's main goal is to demonstrate cultural distance and difference as they pertain to staged representations of Latinx (or Latine) Americans living in the United States. In order to do so, this project maps the difference between the spaces that are occupied by Latinx-Americans and Latinx immigrants and the spaces that represent or claim to represent Latinx Americans in the United States. For this initial stage of the project, this analysis is focused on the city of New York and shows data beginning in the 1940s and 1950s. The resulting map shows where Latines are living and the emergence of Latine community-centered theatres throughout the city of New York as Latine-Americans and Latine immigrants begin to create spaces for self-representation and community celebration. This map shows information gathered from census records, community organizing histories and theatre hubs based mostly in New York.

This project has been supported by the May-Crane Fellowship which allowed collaboration with, contribution to, and invaluable support from the Harvard Map Collection.

...and who is portraying them

:  Seven different species of sea (or marine) turtles grace our ocean waters, from the shallow seagrass beds of the Indian Ocean, to the colorful reefs of the Coral Triangle and the sandy beaches of the Eastern Pacific. While these **highly migratory species** periodically come ashore to either bask or nest, sea turtles spend the bulk of their lives in the ocean. WWF's work on sea turtles focuses on five of those species: green, hawksbill, loggerhead, leatherback, and olive ridley.

Over the last 200 years, **human activities** have tipped the scales against the survival of these ancient mariners. Slaughtered for their eggs, meat, skin, and shells, sea turtles suffer from poaching and over-exploitation. They also face habitat destruction and accidental capture—known as bycatch—in fishing gear. Climate change has an impact on turtle nesting sites; it alters sand temperatures, which then affects the sex of hatchlings. Nearly all species of sea turtle are now classified as endangered, with three of the seven existing species being critically endangered.

## 4. Reflections



WWF is committed to stopping the decline of sea turtles and works for the recovery of the species. We work to secure environments in which both turtles and the people that depend upon them can survive.

## 5. Next Steps and Future Directions

1. **Costa Rica**

    _Playa Grande_ is one of the top locations in the world to see humongous leatherback turtles all year-round. Of the seven turtle species, this one is the largest of them all, weighing up to around 700 kg (1500 lbs). The leatherbacks’ nesting period is between October and March, so visiting at this time means that you can get a special glimpse of hatching eggs and baby turtles making their way to the water.
    Playa Grande is the world’s second largest nesting place for leatherback turtles. In order to see this amazing species, you’ll need to book a tour guide so that their nesting habits are not disturbed and that the eggs are not harmed in any way. Most of the tours are offered late in the evening, typically after sunset to ensure the safety of the turtles, but don’t worry as your guide will show you everything you need to know and much more.

2. **Indonesia**

    The Indonesian _Gili Islands_ are composed of three tiny islands. The islands are home to Green turtles who are vegetarians and Hawksbill turtles who are the most beautiful of them all due to their colourful shells. The turtles are looked after under the protective eye of the island’s Turtle Protection Centre.
    These tropical islands are good for divers, where you can dive up to around 10 metres below sea level. However, if you’re not ready for diving just yet, not to worry, you can take your snorkelling kit and have a swim with these lovely species between the months of March and September.

3. **Australia**

    Australia boasts six of the seven sea turtle species; the green turtle, the hawksbill, leatherback, the olive ridley, the flatback and the loggerhead. The Sea Turtle Foundation recommends visiting the _Heron Islands_ which is south of the Great Barrier Reef and was featured on Sir David Attenborough’s series, The Blue Planet II. During nesting seasons you’ll find both the loggerhead (who are carnivores) and green turtles breeding here. On this island, you’ll be able to get a guided tour to learn more about the turtles and watch them nest. Snorkelling is also a good way to see the sea turtles. Visiting them any time from Spring to fall is a great time to get a glimpse of all the excitement.

4. **Hawaii**

    _Laniakea Beach_, also known as the ‘Turtle Beach’, is on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Oahu near the city Haleiwa. This Hawaiian Paradise is home to one of the rarest species of turtles, the green sea turtle or ‘honu’. Throughout the year, turtles come to this beach to eat from the seaweed and lie on the sand to sunbathe in the sun. This makes them relatively easy to spot whether in the sea or on the shore. Scuba diving and snorkelling are popular amongst tourists here so be sure to bring your gear along. The best time to visit the beach is during spring, summer and fall.

5. **Malaysia**

    _Tioman Island_ is well known for being all about turtles and tropical sunshine. The island is located off the eastern coast of Malaysia, with a turtle protection centre that protects eggs from being consumed by animals and to help the baby turtles safely reach the sea. By visiting Tioman Island between May and October you will be able to find the Green and Hawksbill turtles coming ashore to lay their eggs in the sand. The island is also known for being a top destination for turtle spotting because of its vast amount of coral which attracts the turtles and it also makes it great for snorkelling too.
